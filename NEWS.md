# qmongr 0.7.0

## New feature

TEXT HERE!

## Internal

Check `output$qi_table[["html"]]` instead of `output$qi_table` in tests.

# qmongr 0.6.5

Added dependency: development version of `shiny` from `rstudio/shiny` on github. `moduleServer`, introduced in version `0.6.4`, is not part of `shiny` on cran

# qmongr 0.6.4

## Replaced callModule with moduleServer ([#104](https://github.com/mong/qmongr/pull/104)).

`testModule` is no longer a part of `shiny`, so we had to use `testServer` to test our modules. `callModule` way of running modules and regular functions way of making modules can not be tested by `testServer`. Thus, we had to use `moduleServer` to make modules (and run the modules as regular functions). This is also the recommended way according to `?shiny::callModule`:

> Starting in Shiny 1.5.0, we recommend using moduleServer instead of callModule, because the syntax is a little easier to understand, and modules created with moduleServer can be tested with testServer().

In practice we replaced all
```R
mymodule <- function(input, output, session, arg1, arg2) {
```
with
```R
mymodule <- function(id, arg1, arg2) {
   shiny::moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
```
in the module part, and replaced all
```R
shiny::callModule(mymodule, "myID", arg1 = "blablabla", arg2 = "blablabla2")
```
with
```R
mymodule("myID", arg1 = "blablabla", arg2 = "blablabla2")
```
where we call modules.

## Fix tag deployment ([#102](https://github.com/mong/qmongr/pull/102)).
- Deploy script (`docker_push`) will be launched for all branches
- Script will check if commit should be pushed to Docker hub or not.
- Will push to `hnskde/qmongr:test` if `$TRAVIS_BRANCH` is `master`
- Will push to `hnskde/qmongr:latest` if `$TRAVIS_TAG` is on the format `vX.Y.Z`.
- The script `docker_hub` is moved to https://github.com/mong/scripts for easy reuse. I use the same setup for `tmongr` and `helseatlas` and was tired of updating three places all the time.
